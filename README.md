# mymdb
A basic Internet Movie Database (IMDB) clone called My Movie Database (MyMDB) written in Django 2.2 that we will deploy using Docker. Our IMDB clone will have the following two types of users: users and administrators. The users will be able to rate movies, add images from movies, and view movies and cast. The administrators will be able to add movies, actors, writers, and directors.
